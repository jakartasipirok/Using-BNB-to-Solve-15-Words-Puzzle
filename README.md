## 15 Puzzle Solver Using BNB
A program to find a solution for 15 Puzzle by using Branch and Bound Algorithm for my Algorithm Strategy course
Most of the function and procedure can be optimized, but the main thing is to keep the program short and more understandable

## Requirements
1. Python3
2. numpy module

## How to Run
Make sure you already have python3 install in your desktop
```
1. Clone this repository
2. Open terminal on this repository clone folder
3. type cd src
        python3 main.py
4. Make sure the file to solve already in test folder, you can use default testcase by typing "tc{x}.txt" or add your own file
5. Using random matrix program might cause a very long runtime. Program may take a while to generate solution
```
Enjoy the program.
